### Abstract

Description of an ongoing personal project to develop a flexible system
integrating different approaches to solve a generic problem. The system
is iterative, dynamically partitioning the input space-time, and assigning
each partition to a specific module, picked on the basis of its performance.
This allows to combine multiple strategies to solve the same problem,
providing improved performance, fault tolerance, efficiency, and reducing
its overall cost. The modules are completely generic, e.g. from hard coded
sets of rules to time-dependent neural networks.
